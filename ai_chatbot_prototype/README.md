This is a AI Chatbot prototype.

It is built using langflow. It is a basic flow of how things would work in a real chatbot. It uses ASTRA DB vector database, and uses OpenAI API, to power the chatbot and generate embeddings.

To run it on your machine, run the following command on your machine in cmd or terminal this requires a Python 3.10, some later version of 3.12 might not support it. 

Mac/ Linux:
pip3 install langflow --pre --force-reinstall

Windows:
pip install langflow --pre --force-reinstall

After downloading the file and langflow platform, run this:
langflow run

Then a window might pop up that look like this:

Just drag and drop the json file there to see its structure click run to run it.

Thankyou for checking out my chatbot.
